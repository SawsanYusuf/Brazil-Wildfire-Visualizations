# Brazil-Wildfire-Visualizations

Simple data visualization project I did as a part of a training program at Shai. 

# The idea of the project:
The wildfires in Brazil—specifically the Amazon rainforest, have been under close watch in recent years as the rainforest experiences threats from deforestation and decreasing biodiversity. 

Because wildfires are unfortunately so common, humans have collected a good amount of data from them and can better understand the patterns they make and the relationships they have with the regions they are most likely to spark in.

# The dataset:
We will be using a dataset on wildfires in Brazil from 1998 to 2017. The data was obtained from the official website of the Brazilian government.
The columns represent the year the forest fire happened, the Brazilian state, the month the forest fire happened, the number of forest fires reported, and the date they were reported. 

# The questions we’ll ask for this use case:
1. What Month Will be the Worst for Wildfires in Brazil?
2. What States Have the Highest Number of Wildfires?
3. Has the Average Number of Wildfires Increased in Brazil Year-Over-Year?
